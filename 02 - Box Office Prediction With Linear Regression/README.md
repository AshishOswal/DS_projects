# Predicting Movie Opening Weekend Gross Using Linear Regression

## Notebook organization
All of the working files are in jupyter notebooks. If you are only interested in web scraping and data collection, you may find them in 01 - Luther notebook. These notebooks are sequenctial, so the next part (data cleaning & merging) are in 02 - Luther, and final analysis is in 03 - Luther.

The "test" notebooks are for running the code for Avengers (2018) to see how well my model performed on predicting the opening gross for this movie.

### Data
The data (some in csv, but mostly in pkl form) can be found in this folder.
