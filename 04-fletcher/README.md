# Aspect-Based Opinion Mining

## Notebook organization
All of the working files in the code folder are in jupyter notebooks, although it can easily be converted into python scripts. 
### Code

#### 01 - Building Naive Bayes model
The multi-label Naive Bayes model is trained using the annotated restaurant reviews training dataset.

#### 02 - Sentiment Analysis
This notebook contains the main pipeline for sentiment analysis

#### 03 - Scrap code & Plotly
The final notebook mostly consits of a lot of scrap code (which I will organize in the near future), but it was used to generate plots using plot.ly

### Data folder
The original yelp dataset is not included, because the file is too large. You can easily download the dataset directly from Yelp or through Kaggle.

### Flask folder
Placeholder for the flask app that will be built later.
